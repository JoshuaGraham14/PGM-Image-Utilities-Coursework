Task I
- Module pgmEcho.c
Takes in as input a file of type .pgm and outputs it to a different file.
INPUTS: command-line parameters: inputImage, outputImage.
OUTPUTS: outputImage file contains a copy of the inputImage pgm file.


Task II
- Module pgmComp.c
Takes in two inputs as file of type .pgm and compares them to see if they are 'logically identical'.
INPUTS: command-line parameters: image1, image2.
OUTPUTS: return 0 (success) + print statement reading "IDENTICAL: The two files were identical" if
         the two images are identical OR print statement reading "DIFFERENT: The two files were
         not identical".


Task III
- Module pgma2b.c
Takes in ASCII form of pgm file and converts to binary
INPUTS: command-line parameters: ASCII formatted pgm file, fileLocation2.
OUTPUTS: return 0 (success) + print statement reading "CONVERTED: The file was converted".

- Module pgma2a.c
Takes in binary form of pgm file and converts to ASCII
INPUTS: command-line parameters: binary formatted pgm file, fileLocation2.
OUTPUTS: return 0 (success) + print statement reading "CONVERTED: The file was converted".


Task IV
- Module pgmReduce.c
Takes in an input file of type .pgm (either ASCII or binary) and firstly convert it to ASCII if it
is of type binary, using the pgma2a.c module. The input file is then reduced by a factor of 'intFactor'
in each dimension.
INPUTS: 3 command-line parameters:
        - inputFile - pgm file,
        - intFactor - integer factor n,
        - outputFile - pgm file.
OUTPUTS: outputImage file contains a copy of the inputImage pgm file.
